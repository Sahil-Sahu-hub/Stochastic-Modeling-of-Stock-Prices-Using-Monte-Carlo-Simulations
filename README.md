## Forecasting Appleâ€™s Stock: A Monte Carlo Risk Analysis

This project implements a Monte Carlo simulation to forecast future stock prices based on historical data. By modeling stock price movements as a stochastic process, the simulation generates numerous potential future price paths. This approach provides insights into the range and probability of possible outcomes, aiding in risk assessment and investment decision-making. The project utilizes Python and its libraries, such as NumPy and Matplotlib, to perform simulations and visualize results
