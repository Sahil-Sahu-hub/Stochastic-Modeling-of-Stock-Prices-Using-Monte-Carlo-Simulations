## Project Title
Forecasting Apple’s Stock: A Monte Carlo Risk Analysis  

## Brief One Line Summary
Monte Carlo simulations applied to Apple’s stock to forecast price trajectories and assess risk-return profiles.  

## Overview
This project applies quantitative finance techniques to analyze Apple’s (AAPL) stock price behavior, using Monte Carlo simulations to forecast potential future outcomes. The primary business objective is to evaluate the stock’s expected risk-return distribution, enabling stakeholders to make informed decisions around investment allocation, portfolio diversification, and downside protection strategies.  

The intended audience includes financial analysts, data scientists, portfolio managers, and risk officers who need scenario-driven insights into stock price uncertainty. The deliverable is a reproducible Python workflow that generates simulations, visualizations, and statistical distributions to support both tactical and strategic decision-making.  

The output includes:
- Historical data exploration for AAPL.  
- Simulation of 100 potential price paths over a 300-day horizon.  
- Comparative density plots of historical vs. simulated prices.  
- Actionable recommendations for investment and risk management.  

## Problem Statement
Equity markets exhibit high volatility, making single-point forecasts unreliable. For AAPL, price uncertainty complicates portfolio allocation and risk mitigation. The problem is to quantify the potential distribution of future prices using a stochastic model and evaluate its deviation from historical trends. The impact is significant: misjudging stock trajectory could erode portfolio returns or expose stakeholders to unmanaged downside risk.

## Tools and Technologies
- **Programming Language:** Python 3.11  
- **Libraries:**  
  - Data handling: `pandas`, `numpy`  
  - Financial data: `yfinance`  
  - Visualization: `matplotlib`, `seaborn`  
  - Utilities: `tqdm`, `warnings`  
- **Environment:** Jupyter Notebook / Python scripts  
- **Version Control:** Git, GitHub  

## Methods
1. **Data Acquisition**  
   - Downloaded historical stock prices for AAPL via `yfinance` (from 2021-01-01 onwards).  

2. **Data Preparation**  
   - Extracted closing prices.  
   - Computed daily returns (`pct_change`).  
   - Dropped null values for clean time series.  

3. **Statistical Analysis**  
   - Calculated average daily return and volatility.  
   - Derived drift term (`avg_daily_return - 0.5 * daily_volatility**2`) for log-normal modeling.  

4. **Monte Carlo Simulation**  
   - Ran 100 simulation paths over 300 trading days.  
   - Applied stochastic differential equation with Gaussian shocks.  

5. **Visualization**  
   - Generated line plots of simulated paths.  
   - Compared historical vs. simulated price distributions via KDE/density plots.  

6. **Evaluation**  
   - Computed average simulated price and standard deviation.  
   - Benchmarked against historical mean/volatility.  

7. **Validation**  
   - Cross-checked distributional properties (fat tails, skewness).  
   - [Optional] Backtest simulations with past holdout data.  

## Key Insights
- Average simulated price ≈ 275 (vs. historical mean ≈ 174), reflecting growth expectations embedded in current market behavior.  
- Simulated standard deviation (≈ 67) is almost double historical volatility, suggesting increased uncertainty.  
- Current spot price (~238) aligns closer to simulation mean, confirming that markets anticipate future appreciation.  
- Extreme simulation outcomes (>600 or <150) highlight tail risks that investors should hedge against.  
- Investors should not rely on single-point predictions; instead, focus on probability distributions.  
- Risk managers must stress-test portfolios against worst-case scenarios, not just averages.  

## Results & Conclusion

Historical Mean Price: ~174.41, Std Dev: ~34.79.

Simulated Mean Price: ~274.59, Std Dev: ~67.31.

Distribution analysis shows that the Monte Carlo method anticipates both higher upside and more pronounced downside risk.
